          <h2>Powercoders AWS RE/START (part-time)</h2>
          <p>
            AWS re/Start is a free, part-time skills development program to
            jump-start your career working in cloud computing. We offer a 6
            month part-time AWS course, followed by an 6 - 12 month internship.
            In the course you prepare for AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner
            certification with free access to practice and full exams. After you
            graduate, we will connect you with employers and help you move into
            your new working life. The application period for the pilot program
            is over and if the pilot goes as expected, we will most likely start
            another AWS re/start program in 2023.

            are supported by volunteer trainers to help answer questions from
            the participants and provide 1:1 support during exercises. You can
            either volunteer onsite in the classroom (2+ half day commitment) or
            online (2h of non continuous support on participants questions about
            simple frontend development). Alternatively you can present online
            about your typical day or your IT advice (2h online on Zoom). If you
            are an IT professional, would like to support our participants.
